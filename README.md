# Project Overview
---

This project involved a dataset containing data on the different brands and models of smartwatches available in the market. The datasets also give information about the specifications that are watched out for by buyers when shopping for a smartwatch. This data analysis project aims to explore the various specifications of wristwatch brands and look at the more suitable brands in terms of functionality, health specifications, and cost-efficiency for buyers.

# Data Sources
---
This data was sourced from Kaggle.com, an online source for diverse datasets [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/smart-watch-prices]

# Tools Used
--- 
Microsoft Excel - for primarily housing the data
Power BI - for data cleaning and transformation, and for data visualization

# Data Cleaning and Manipulation
---
Exploratory data analysis was performed to:
1. Splitting of column
2. Create conditional columns to create more measures
3. Remove empty and duplicate rows
4. Remove N/As
5. Changed data types
6. Made sure the OS is consistent in the column for better visualization
